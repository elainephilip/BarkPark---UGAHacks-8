# BarkPark---UGAHacks-8
Our project allows a user to see exactly what parking spots are open in each of the UGA parking lots. By designing the UI of our application Bark Park with the user’s preferences in mind, we were able to construct a visual representation of how to operate our application. Bark Park not only allows users to view all parking decks’ current occupancy but also allows users to select a given deck and view where exactly the vacant spots are, on every level in the deck. The code is a replication of the implmentation of the code if we had data from sensors to use.
